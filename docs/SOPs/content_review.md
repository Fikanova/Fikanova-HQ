# SOP: Content Review & Approval

> Standard Operating Procedure for reviewing AI-generated content through the Editor's Desk.

---

## Overview

All AI-generated content (newsletters, social posts, case studies) flows through the **Editor's Desk** before publishing. This ensures brand consistency and allows human refinement of AI output.

---

## Access

- **Dashboard**: [dashboard.fikanova.co.ke/editor](https://dashboard.fikanova.co.ke/editor)
- **WhatsApp**: Reply to draft notification with "Approved" or feedback

---

## Workflow

```
AI Draft → Editor Agent (Brand Voice) → Review Queue → Human Edit → Approve/Reject
```

### 1. Draft Arrives

You'll receive a WhatsApp notification:
> 📝 Draft ready for review: [Title]
> Reply 'Approved' or send feedback.

### 2. Review Options

**Option A: Quick Approval (WhatsApp)**
- Reply "Approved" → Content publishes immediately
- Reply "Approved [minor edit]" → Publishes with your edit

**Option B: Detailed Edit (Dashboard)**
1. Open Editor's Desk
2. Click on pending draft
3. Review AI version (left panel)
4. Make edits (right panel)
5. Click Approve

**Option C: Reject & Regenerate**
1. Provide feedback in the notes field
2. Click "Reject & Regenerate"
3. Editor Agent rewrites with your feedback

## Feedback Guidelines

Good feedback helps the AI learn your preferences.

### ❌ Bad Feedback
- "Make it better"
- "Too long"
- "Wrong tone"

### ✅ Good Feedback
- "Use shorter sentences, max 10 words each"
- "Reference the 3 Elements Theory in the opening"
- "Too corporate - channel my X profile voice"
- "Cut the first paragraph, start with the stat"

## CIMP Learning

When you edit content:
1. System compares AI draft vs. your edit
2. Patterns are logged to `Learning_Traces`
3. Editor Agent's prompts improve over time

Your edits literally train the AI.
