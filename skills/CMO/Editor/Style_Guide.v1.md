## Writing Rules

### General
1. Short sentences. Punchy.
2. Max 2 sentences per paragraph on social media
3. Active voice always
4. Numbers over words (use "3" not "three")
5. Lead with the benefit, not the feature

### Forbidden Words
- "Synergy"
- "Leverage" (as a verb)
- "Holistic"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Best-in-class"
- "ROI" (say "return" or be specific)
- "Ecosystem" (unless literally about nature)

### Preferred Alternatives
| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "Implement" | "Build" or "Add" |
| "Facilitate" | "Help" or "Enable" |
| "Leverage" | "Use" or specific action |
| "Solution" | Name the actual thing |
